# babel-plugin-react-hot
Babel plugin using [`react-hot-api`](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-api) to add hot reloading to `React.createClass` and all classes with a `render` method.

99% of this can be accredited to [`babel-plugin-react-hotify`](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-hotify).  This particular repo was made to support the original [`react-hot-api`](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-api) as a Babel plugin.
